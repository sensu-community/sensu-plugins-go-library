## [0.17.0] - 2023-02-07

### Breaking
- Moved from github.com/sensu/sensu-go/api/core/v2 to github.com/sensu/core/v2.
This breaks all existing consumers of the library. Luckily, the fix is simple.
Just replace all core/v2 imports with the new library at github.com/sensu/core.
Doing this saves Go from needing to deal with the entirety of sensu-go, and
will be beneficial to library users long-term by speeding up builds.
